{action 0} could be a mouse[doubleclick] or key_pressed[enter]
selected items should be highlighted in a different color (defaults included with tkinter listboxes)

basic operation goals:
	view files and folders
	navigate folders
	sort files and folders by (date created, last modified, file size, name)
	show folders first/show files first/ignore file vs folder (all mixed together)
	toggle hide system files/folders (begin with . on linux)
	copy file/folder
	move file/folder
	create archive from selection
easy extended:
	<C-w> (ctrl-w) [hjkl] to switch focus to another widget
	preview pictures
	download files (provided address, wget (easy) also maybe have some intellegence about resuming a download or chose location based on downloaded item i.e. last item downloaded from domain "canvas.com" went into "usf/classes" so lets open that folder)
extended:
	select files in current folder by regular expression
	filter files/folders displayed by regular expression
	find files by search (search file names in current dir)
	scratch this if regex does same thing ---rename files by vimregex (:%s/vi/VIM/gc)---

screens needed
	most used screen, Explorer
		a large listbox shows files and folders, command bar to take commands


view files in current directory
{action 0} on a directory in the current view will take you into the directory and display the files and dirs in that dir
{action 0} on a file in the current view call the default action for the os on that file (open it with default program)
	it could be pretty easy to allow the program itself to display the picture (not easy for eg pdf)
if i hit [down] then the first item should become selected and more presses of [down] move the selection down (likewise for up)

stretch goal:
if i hold [ctrl] and press [down] then the previously selected item should remain selected and a new select box (outline) will move down (its in windows)
